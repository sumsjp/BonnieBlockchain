 There's a common misconception with the GPU scarcity problem, which is everyone thinks just we need more GPUs. I need more bullets! That is pretty far from the truth. We're the only ones in deepin or in crypto that are able to do that today. There's no point in buying a ton of bullets if you don't have soldiers that know how to shoot or you don't have the right guns to use them. Most web3 companies don't want to show their revenue because if they did, everyone would realize that this project is grossly overvalued. All these enterprise-grade compute providers, they work on very very long extended contracts. There's difficulty. Different regions get different contracts at different times and so if you have a single aggregation layer, it makes it a lot cleaner and a lot simpler and then when you bring it crypto economics, token economics to it, you're actually able to provide, as I said, a significantly lower cost. That's why I love to hear it. Let's say you have like a $50 chip. As long as there's access to the internet and has a screen, you can plug into the cloud and you can have an iPhone. Can this underutilized computer actually do what the AI needs to do? A lot of these deepened projects are still more affected by general crypto sentiment than it is by the AI sentiment. We see crypto projects addressing this GPU scarcity problem by selling nodes. It allows users to provide their own GPU compute power for these AI gaming movie companies to use. A company would need GPU that are operational 24x7. When the GPUs are controlled by retail users, isn't it difficult to prevent issues like power cuts or shortages? That is one of the reasons why Aether is probably the only deepened project that can truly actually service these enterprise-grade customers. Every single deepened project today does something very very unique. Obviously within deepen, we're all competing for mindsharing, we're all competing for user recognition, but what we do at a business level is very very different. IONET acts as a very high-level orchestration layer. Render is very much so for consumer compute to plug in and do render jobs. You have projects like GRASS which is using essentially your computer's bandwidth and for us we're really really focused on this enterprise-grade gaming and AI use cases. Very few companies in the world that can actually provide cloud gaming to hundreds of millions of users at the same time. In web 2 or web 3, there's maybe a total of 10 to 20 companies that can do it. In web 3, there's definitely only one. It's hard for any crypto company to say that they have guaranteed buying or guaranteed demand for the utility of the token. So when I hear your revenue, I'm like wow that sounds like a lot, but how does that number compare to other deepened projects? It's not going to sound great when I say it, but we have more monthly revenue than the lifetime revenue of all other deepened projects combined. Well hi Dayden. Hey Bonnie. Well thank you for being here. You are the web 3 chief architect of Aether. What is a web 3 chief architect? Essentially what I oversee is a lot of our native web 3 activity. That includes token swaps, staking, DeFi integrations, building out more of the protocol as well. The Aether team has a very very strong and extensive background in cloud gaming, low latency inference, AI, building distributed GPU cloud, and I came on to add a little bit more web 3 native flavor to the core team. That's essentially what I look at. Also building out pieces for governance and you know foundation setup and things like that. So you are crypto native? Yeah, so I've been in crypto I think almost five years now, closing in on the anniversary since I first lost a ton of money buying Bitcoin. What were you doing before joining Aether then? When I was in university I had a very small startup in Singapore that was mainly doing marketing and high quality video production for brands like Porsche, McLaren, Bentley, a long list of automotive clients here in Singapore. I worked with that company and then got into web 3 and started Degenic. Prior to Aether I was building a protocol as well, but I've since left the team to you know go full time with Aether. The next question is people who are building AI related web 3 projects, what do you see them in common? Like did they have a common background or have they worked in big tech? In the crypto space what I've mostly seen is there's kind of two subsets. One is the consumer facing group right which is they're building a lot in AI agents, right, consumer tools, rappers around chat GPT with token incentives. A lot of these are tend to be younger guys from top universities in the US right building out of that new Silicon Valley culture. I think a lot of them were crypto users or crypto natives because of the AI boom they saw a lot of opportunity in merging the two worlds. Then there's also the infrastructure side which is a lot of really the deep tech guys, the founder of 4G who got into crypto and is now building AI protocol as well. A lot of these guys that are building on the infrastructure side right solving a lot of the incentive problems with like open and closed source in AI that we see today. Very interesting demographic I think of crypto builders in AI. Because we see there is huge problem with GPU scarcity worldwide and companies like Google, Meta, they're just racing to buy more and more Nvidia GPUs and it seems like people just can't get enough GPUs. So tell us what is happening behind the scene. There's a common misconception with the GPU scarcity problem which is everyone thinks just we need more GPUs. I need more bullets. That is pretty far from the truth. There are already a lot of data centers with a lot of existing whether it's high-end to mid-end to even low-end compute that's out there. The reason Amazon and Google want to amass a lot of this is because they have really good control of the real bottleneck in the GPUs which is the software layer. In the GPU space we have kind of three stacks that go from the infrastructure as a service layer, the platform as a service layer, to the software as a service layer. The software as a service layer is essentially what's closest to what users are used to with their applications and you know SaaS tools that companies use. But between those tools like everything that you see on the internet and the actual GPU that's powering that compute there's actually a layer in between which is the software layer right which encompasses all of the capabilities that you can do on these computers which include data cleansing, different types of rendering services, different types of cloud hosting right server hosting and things like that. And so when we look at the overall space Amazon, Google they have really really robust platform layers built either on top of them or with them and that's why it makes a lot of sense for them to amass GPUs. The web3 approach has always been give more utilization to these underutilized GPUs right we're aggregating GPUs from data centers from consumers to be able to be used by applications but what's starkly lacking and what I like to talk a lot about with Ather is this platform layer where Ather's team actually has 10-15 years of experience building out cloud infrastructure and that's why we're able to you know we'll talk about this later on but provide some of these cloud gaming, cloud phone, AI training use cases to the biggest companies in the world. We're the only ones in deep end one crypto that are able to do that today and it's largely because there's a lack of software expertise that can actually use this GPU and so you can think about it as like there's no point in buying a ton of bullets if you don't have soldiers that know how to shoot or you don't have the right guns to use them. Can you tell me more about the software you said there's a lack of software? There's a lot lack of software expertise right and so let's think about it this way one of the capabilities that Ather's built is the ability to do cloud gaming so for example you could go to League of Legends without having to download it this gets more and more important in the gaming sector because as games you know get more AAA they get more high quality the file sizes start to become ridiculous you can't be downloading like a 500 gigabyte game onto your macbook trying to play it in making that happen between the GPU that can actually power and host these games to the user experiencing it and actually being able to play it there's a lot of software in the middle that actually needs to execute on this rendering right real-time instances all of these different platform the hardware to actually be able to do the things that we want them to do to create these capabilities that's where Ather's team has a really really strong advantage because of our experiences and what we've been doing you know what the team's been doing for the past 10 to 15 years that's where there's a huge lack today right if you look at other deep end projects like Render or Ionet a lot of them are just being used for really simple AI inferences very generic AI rendering use cases hey generate 50 photos for me and you know you can take like two weeks to do as opposed to cloud gaming where you need to use that powerful GPU to create an immediate render for the user to be able to play it like tens millions of players to be able to play it within the same server. You said the team has 10 to 15 years of experience what were you doing before Ather then? The team not including me but the team has a lot of past experience if we look at from our CEO Dan who was the ex-CEO of Riot Games China all the way down to Kyle our CTO with you know 10-15 years building AI capabilities different AI tech even way before the AI boom some of our software and development team that's built a lot of the cloud infrastructure across Asia and greater Asia during the cloud boom from 2010 to 2020. Ather's team came together somewhere between 2018 to 2019 to really address the GPU shortage that was in gaming back then and throughout that time we've built a ton of infrastructure support things like cloud gaming cloud phone up until before the protocolization or till today we've amassed over 30 million closing in on 40 million in annualized revenue and that number is now or it's projected to significantly spike because we have so much demand for this compute from the AI sector. The team came together as people with 10 to 15 years of experience building out Tencent cloud cloud gaming infrastructure live stream platforms some of the largest live stream platforms in the world with really this vision of building software that works and allows high-end enterprise companies to be able to access cheaper and underutilized compute. What is Ather or other web3 projects relationship with web2 companies like are they selling the compute power to them and at what scale? A lot of web3 projects what they're really doing is aggregating compute underutilized compute from different data center consumers giving allowing that compute to be used by their client. The problem like I said is because a lot of these T-Pen projects lacked the software layer to do really interesting capabilities that actually cost a ton of money these clients that AWS and Google cloud tend to serve. The revenue numbers are actually very very lacking. Some of these companies have public revenue reports right some of them don't and this is where Ather kind of comes in and changes this. Ather has been building out this infrastructure in a more centralized way in the past and we have accrued 30-40 million in ARR annualized revenue as we have shifted last month and this month towards the decentralized model where anyone can plug into this network anyone can provide compute to these clients. What you're seeing is the existing compute providers are purchasing this amount of ATH to actually utilize the network right and so that's where you can expect that there is going to be a lot of demand or a lot of utilization of the token and to make this more fair most web3 companies don't want to show their revenue because if they did everyone would realize that this project is grossly overvalued right if you look at it from a revenue perspective obviously revenue is not the only way to measure the value of a company but that's where Ather stands out. Ather actually has built demand and real revenue we've been servicing some of the largest game companies in the world the largest telcos in the world that serve hundreds of millions to billions of users. I'm not currently at liberty to disclose the names of these companies but because we have this revenue what we're going to be releasing between July and August is this thing that I've called proof of revenue and what that means is a lot of this revenue and a lot of this demand for compute is actually going to be publicly showcased in our dashboard that's up and coming and also seen on visibly on chain as purchases of ATH to use our protocol so that users can actually understand and see that there's real demand for this this utility there's real demand for this network that can give them more confidence in the project. I know you can't disclose the names but can you describe who are these companies? One of them is the game publisher of probably the most famous mobile game in the world. It's a shooting game. Both the publisher and developer and owner of one of the largest games in the world multiplayer games in the world as well so those are you know our cloud gaming use cases on the cloud phone side we also have probably the largest telco in the world by user count. Again I can't say their name but based on that description users can probably go and speculate which company that is there's only a couple that are not getting that. I assume it's in the US. It is not. What? Well it's not okay okay. Well I mean those are based on country right so there's a couple geographies in the world that have the most. Yeah yeah it's in Asia. Maybe okay. Why did the team create Aether? Because you guys were serving web 2 companies or these team members were working for web 2 companies and I assume they're very successful. Why Aether? The main problem that Aether has always addressed whether it was in a traditional model or now in the web 3 model is the ability for the next generation of enterprise-grade GPU use cases right whether that's very high-end AI training with billions of parameters for model training or that's like I said cloud gaming for billions of users. Why we decided to go ahead and create a distributed network? It just makes a ton of sense that you actually have a very very large distributed network and they're all incentivized through one structure right and so where the token the protocol comes in is it's really solving an incentivization problem whereas if I have a distributed network where I have H100s from all around the world they plug into my network whenever they don't have SLA that's ongoing they can plug in and they can commit for some number of time you can think about them like all these enterprise-grade compute providers they work on very very long-standing contracts there's difficulty different regions get different contracts at different times and so if you have a single aggregation layer it makes it a lot cleaner and a lot simpler and then when you bring in crypto economics token economics to it you're actually able to provide these at a significantly lowered cost as compared to doing it in a fully centralized way because again if I'm let's say a H100 in Malaysia I can only service Malaysian clients I need to have a higher base fee or a higher base service fee to be able to make sure that I'm profitable but if I'm plugging into this network and I'm able to receive jobs from different places and there's a software layer in between that's aggregating and distributing for me I can already lower my initial base cost and then on top of that we have like token stipends tokens that essentially act as very liquid credits to help bootstrap the system but that's where you can amass a ton of high-end compute that can better serve our already existing long list of high-end enterprise-grade clients. So you are already an established web2 company that turned web3 is that correct? Yes and and we're now translating all of that revenue into buying ATH to use the protocol. Well that's so interesting and you already have like an established customer base in web2 right? Yeah exactly. Can you tell us more about your customers like when you switch from web2 to web3 does that change your customer base? Not at all so what we've done to make this possible is we've created this thing that the team likes to call a web2 service layer and so what that means is the experience for the customer the traditional customer of this enterprise they can't pay in ATH they can't pay in USDT they can only pay fiat currency they can continue to have this existing service and what we have in the middle is essentially a software layer that allows these users to pay us so well not Aether Foundation but Aether Capital they pay Aether in USD and then there's a conversion into ATH and then that is directly used to purchase the compute from our network over each week to ensure that there's consistent uptime and the GPU providers are still being rewarded the same amount so yeah there's essentially no change to the revenue that we're realizing there's no change to the customer base they're very satisfied with the you know existing uptime the existing performance of the GPUs all we're doing is allowing all of that revenue to flow into our protocol and flow into our decentralized network to make it even more bullish during the bootstrap period. That's why I love to hear like a real use and like existing revenue stream you do have four business units right cloud gaming um cloud phone AI training and edge compute what are the differences? So cloud gaming like I mentioned is imagine you can play any game without needing to download it right because the game is hosted on a server right now there's two major use cases one is AAA games that are extremely big in file size to allow users to experience it before download the second is with you know even smaller to medium games there's actually a huge barrier of user acquisition when you're trying to convince the user to sign up and download the game and so what we do for these companies is hey here's a link it allows you to play a 15 minute demo of the game it automatically creates an account for you if you play the game and you like it you have way more incentive to then download the game and sign up right and so we work with a lot of these smaller to medium gaming companies to offer this it's very cheap if you're only allowing the user to play for let's say 10 15 minutes of the demo and it significantly lowers the barrier of entry for the user to have the first gaming experience with cloud phone cloud phone is actually very very interesting what it is is essentially hosting the entire hardware capability of your phone on a cloud and so what that means is with a link let's say you have like a $50 chip as long as access to the internet has a screen you could plug into the cloud and you could have an iphone right you could be using an iphone you have the same capabilities as an iphone or even you know the highest end mobile phone out there just through that cloud instance and so we see a huge demand for this in asia right now because a lot of users there maybe they don't want to spend a thousand dollars on an iphone but what they can do is you know buy a 200 phone and then pay 10 a month for a subscription service that essentially creates these cloud phone instances for them and allows them to have the experience of using an iphone without needing to buy an iphone ai training is something that everyone is familiar with we're special compared to other japan projects just like i mentioned because we have by far the most number of high end gpus right we have over 4 000 h100s all the h100s probably 100x of all the h100s in the rest of deepin or crypto combined apart from io which has a thousand h100s listed on their platform but those are our h100s as well and so when you have this critical mass of high end compute what you're essentially able to do is provide close to centralized level services for ai training right and so we have companies running 750 million parameter models that are being trained on our cloud infrastructure which is really awesome and then finally edge compute edge compute what it's really talking about is low latency inference for ai and so what that means is bringing the inference closer to you and so for example let's say you're using chat gpt running an instance to ask you the question if the servers are hosted far away from you it takes longer for the instance to run right or for that inference to happen and so having these edge computing devices distributed around the world allows the inference to happen closer to the user meaning it can happen a lot faster with text generation it's not a big problem but then when you go to video generation ai agents right we see a huge demand for companies or networks with edge compute capabilities and so that's why our first partner aether edge they've built these devices in partnership with pocom that has this chip that allows for over 100 different models or types of inferences to be run on it and we're using that to service our existing clients that just triggered three questions the first is on cloud phone i did not know that was happening in asia what can you tell me more about cloud phone so people buy like a cheaper version and then they plug it into their computer so they're not plugging into their computer how we've been doing it so far is directly in partnership with the telco so remember i mentioned we have partnerships with the largest telco in the world by user base and the service they offer is essentially this you can buy any phone you want from the telco buy a sim card when you connect to that telcos internet service there's an option that's you know on top of your subscription let's say you're paying like 15 a month for your phone bill you pay an additional 10 and what that telco does is it allows you to plug into this cloud where it's hosting the rest of the phone software for you what it is is like you you would download an app and then it creates a new instance on your chip that allows you to use like a second phone that's in your phone moving back to the cloud and so what that means is you can have your mobile phone today whatever it is and you can plug it into it you pay this 10 subscription it plugs into the telcos network and that cloud infrastructure basically gives your phone way more capabilities so again like for example you can have an iphone running on a 200 phone the phone that you have is not an iphone right the hardware isn't an iphone but it has the capabilities of an iphone that's the software level is hosted on the cloud for you so it'll look like an ios system yeah exactly and it could do all the things that an ios system can do traditionally like your 200 phone wouldn't be able to do why would apple allow that yeah so that's that's a different question entirely what we're mostly using it for right now is essentially like very specific services that allow you to for example with a single phone right you could spin up like five different accounts right let's say you wanted to have five different accounts that act as five different personas right or you wanted to have separate instances for let's say your wechat your alipay right you have one instance that's mainly for your bank account and then one instance that's mainly for gaming for example right uh your phone is you know it's cheaper so it doesn't really have the bandwidth to handle all these things at the same time you can spin up separate instances for that and do them separately and it doesn't overload your phone oh okay that makes a lot more sense we see crypto projects addressing this gpu scarcity problem by selling nodes right so basically allows users to provide their own gpu compute power for these ai gaming movie companies to use and from these companies perspective though they want reliable supply so for example an ai startup or gaming company would need gpu that are operational 24 7 but my question is when the gpus are controlled by retail users isn't it difficult to prevent issues like power cuts or shortages that is one of the reasons why aether is probably the only deep end project that can truly actually service these enterprise grade customers let's say you're using my macbook right to render these 50 images rendering images is okay if you have no timeline for it right let's say i'm okay with these 50 images being rendered in two weeks you don't care if i'm using my laptop to play teamfight tactics or watch netflix half the time yeah but in true web 2 enterprises if you're servicing like i said these billions of users for cloud gaming or for you know cloud phone instances network uptime is really really important right and in the web 2 traditional gpu world we have these things called sla which basically mean as a compute provider i guarantee you a certain like 99 uptime or 95 uptime and i guarantee you that there's commitment of the bandwidth right of this machine to be working on yours and that's why aether is currently allowing our onboarding compute providers based on a whitelist segmentation right or through a whitelist function we do allow and we will allow you know any and every user to be able to come in and contribute to the network but the types of jobs you might receive or you might be eligible for are very different if you're a consumer that again is like plugging in your macbook to the network you might you will still be eligible for these smaller jobs and you know smaller projects or smaller compute jobs if the user doesn't have a really high sla or have a really big demand for uptime but for the large enterprises that we're serving right if a compute provider wants to come in they want to provide 100 hate 100s right like tens hundreds of million dollars of compute then there is a requirement within the network that they guarantee the uptime otherwise they'll get slash and then we'll pick another compute provider or another you know really high-end enterprise-grade gpu to do the job for them if i have a macbook for example what type of job can my gpu do some level of ai inference right so for example running an instance of gpt to some level of rendering if you're talking about game rendering you could probably host a game for like five to ten players they do run in the background but they're used when you're using the laptop right so when a lot of these deep end projects talk about underutilized gpu what they're really talking about okay you're having lunch or you're sleeping right your computer is on not doing anything your gpu is not being used it's right it's in the background your second question is on io.net you said a hundred of their gpus are yours i don't know right now i think they have about a thousand five hundred h100 under system a thousand of them are ours a thousand okay why are you sharing your gpus with iota net so it sounds like you guys are not competitors you guys are more like partners and what you can think about ather's focus as is really serving these enterprise clients right high end enterprise grade gaming ai use cases and to do that we need to have compute providers that have robust stock right you can think about a robust like bandwidth of these h100 machines right but it doesn't mean these h100 machines are always in use and so whereas io is really a compute orchestration layer right and so what we're doing is we're listing these devices on io net and so if you're a compute provider and you wanted to gain access to a h100 you can gain access to our h100s right from our network directly through io net's interface if these h100s are being taken up and being used for other purposes then you wouldn't be able to rent them on io net server anymore now so you can think of it as like we have a bunch of seats on airplanes and we don't really care if it's being bought from trip.com or it's from like click or it's being bought from expedia it's just another place where we can list these devices now here's a question how would you describe ather to let's say your grandparents that's something i think about every day imagine right now there's a huge demand for gpus all the people with these really high-end gpus they can come in they can plug in they can provide compute to these gaming companies these telco companies these ai companies at very very high guarantees at enterprise grade that needs to fit their needs and we do it because we have really really advanced software so who do you think your competitors are honestly the way i see deep in today is that it's almost too early for there to be a competitive scene every single deep in project today does something very very unique obviously within deep in we're all competing for mind sharing we're all competing for user recognition but what we do at a business level is very very different iownet acts as a very high level orchestration layer render is very much so for consumer compute to plug in and do render jobs you have projects like grass which is using essentially your your computer's bandwidth and for us we're really really focused on this enterprise grade gaming and ai use cases and so in the business model there's virtually no competition in the web3 space but again all of us are deep in projects when retail looks for you know which deep in project to bet on they're looking at all of us equally so that's usually how i think about the problem so if users look at you equally then what sets you apart i think what really sets us apart is the fact that we're able to generate and accrue real revenue one because of the actually massive amount of high end enterprise grade compute and compute machines we have and then two is again the actual software layer that we built that's able to enable these use cases very few companies in the world that can actually provide cloud gaming to hundreds of millions of users at the same time in web2 or web there's maybe a total of 10 to 20 companies that can do it in web3 there's definitely only one and it's a though because we have these software capabilities and this huge amount of high-end compute that means we're actually able to service real enterprise clients that means we actually have real contracts right we have projected you know almost 250 million arr in the next work year and based on our protocol design in order for this arr to be converted to compute it first has to be converted to ath and i think that's a very very standout point right is there is just a lot of natural demand for the token even before the token was released because of the way we built out the ecosystem and that's definitely a standout point i think not just in deep in but for any crypto company i think it's hard for any crypto company to say that they have guaranteed by like buying or guarantee demand for the utility of the token so when i carry a revenue i'm like wow that sounds like a lot but how does that number compare to other deep in projects it's not going to sound great when i say it but we have more monthly revenue than the lifetime revenue of all other deep in projects combined based on whatever information is public today that's insane what are some exciting projects that you're working on i heard there is a phone and there is impossible finance can you tell us more about that so a phone is one of the projects within our ecosystem it's not built by ether ourselves it's a web that looked at our platform capabilities and we're like hey we want to build a web 3 version of this we also have like i said ether edge which is a manufacturing company that came in and said look hey you know we have tons of experience in building hardware we have this partnership with qualcomm we want to build these edge mining devices to power your edge computing use cases these smaller ecosystem projects or or even larger ecosystem projects like rivals like carvin web 3 that are building in gaming and ai that are plugging in and directly using our compute and so that's what our ecosystem looks like with impossible finance we have a very very close relationship with them we're working with them to incubate more projects and i'm actively overseeing that as i build out the aether grants program the aether eco fund to be able to better support projects that want to build on top of our compute and built on top of our ecosystem and on top of that we also have a ton more partnerships on the more defi native side we just announced one with sofon where users can stake ath and then they can go and restake it with sofon to be able to get more rewards on more tokens and a lot of our partners that do use our compute they actually do end up providing additional tokens somewhere between 0.5 to 2 percent of their fdb to actually reward our users whether that's the checker note holders or that's the stakers that are securing the network for us that's essentially all that we're cooking there's a lot to summarize it what's up and coming really is more partnerships more clients more revenue and also more defi native use cases and finally governance which i'm hoping to launch in about two to three months exciting any more alphas you can share with us for the viewers today we're going to be releasing publicly a lot more on information about the partnership with ione pre-tg both announced a 50 million dollar token swap and that you know tokens office men to reward users within our mutual ecosystems see before this interview i thought you and i own it our competitors but now you guys are just like best friends working together i think what we both recognize is that without each other uh it's like it's very hard usually for one project to build a sector right of crypto by itself if you look at the l2 space arbitraum optimism base they all came together they're all slightly different but they work together to build out the entire segment right of that industry and i think we both recognize that without each other it's very hard for us to stand alone and say like hey deep in matters or like deep in is a real thing if there's only one project working on it and so we love to see them win and i hope they feel the same i checked your tokenomics and it says checkers and compute providers will get half of the total token allocation can you tell us more about that so how we've broken it down is like i said aether was built as a protocol to bootstrap a network that actually makes sense the checkers you can think of them as server management software right and so they make sure that all the compute providers are actually honest and providing compute and doing the jobs like they said they would similar to how traditional server management software would maintain the slas then we have the actual compute providers that are plugging in you know they're h100s high end gpus t4s m4s into our network and doing the compute jobs and then we have edge compute with aether edge recently to start releasing these devices to the public where users can essentially run these machines at home and support these ai inference use cases if i'm interested now how can i participate because the aether licenses are not transferable for the first year the best way for someone that's new to the aether ecosystem to participate is one either by getting yourself an aether edge device or two participating in our staking pools so we have two staking pools either gaming as well as aether ai they all have native ath rewards for staking your tokens but you also get additional tokens from our partners depending on which will you stake in so you if you stake in the gaming pool gaming projects that use our compute would then add tokens to the submission pool if you're staking to the ai pool then ai projects that use our computer partner with us would then add tokens to this pool instead what is the stake token for so what the stake token it really is allowing for better crypto economic security of the network it's not validator staking or proof of stake like ethereum is because we're not an l1 blockchain what staking does is it essentially secures the network from an economic standpoint for the compute providers and also the edge devices they also stake this is you know they stake a certain amount so that if they're acting maliciously or trying to manipulate the rewards then there's a lot full of tokens there to punish them for users that aren't compute providers or don't have an edge device the staking is essentially a way to show commitment and belief to the long-term revenue and also the long-term build of aether now we want to talk about d-pin because d-pin this term was created by mizari in late 2022 so pretty late and the work this this term started gaining attention only last year late last year i remember when it first came out many people questioned this narrative because this concept has been around for a while if it's been around for a while why has it only become popular now like what has changed we always talk about render as like the first d-bit right and it's really interesting because they came out and did this before d-bin was a thing they were like hey why don't we just use crypto to incentivize underutilized gpus to do compute jobs right the problem of compute being underutilized has existed for a really really long time i think the shifting point is definitely an ai in the past there wasn't really a gpu shortage so no one really cared if there was a ton of underutilized compute but now with the boom ai there's huge demand for compute and when you do have a gpu shortage right it's like when you run out of money suddenly you remember you have coins like that you left around very simple concept but for the entire kind of ai and tech industry that's what they're starting to realize and that's why there's more and more emphasis on hey d-pin makes sense but again i think there's still a very very big gap here where you see a huge demand for compute but for the underutilized computer for spare compute to actually be able to be used for what the demand needs there's a huge gap in the software layer between you know the platform as a service and software as a service layers some of the so called ai coins or ai products may not actually be ai but just simply an ai meme coin what are some problems you see in the ai and d-pin sector in web3 right now but the biggest problem is like between ai and d-pin the story makes a lot of sense again ai needs a ton of compute there's a ton of underutilized compute why don't we just bootstrap it using crypto or using a token and then we can bridge that gap but again the real gap there is can this underutilized compute actually do what the ai needs to do and in time or yeah what whether it can actually train that you know really really large model or it can really render those pictures the compute that's being provided needs to have the right amount of uptime the right amount of server management the right type of server management software and the right software in between to to actually have it do the right work and so that's kind of where the gap is today and i think if users are really looking at which projects to believe in the numbers actually show very obviously from revenue so two things one is revenue and then two is utilization rate there are d-pin projects that have millions of underutilized compute plugged into them but even after you plug into the network it's still underutilized and it's not underutilized because there's no demand for this type of compute it's underutilized because there's a gap in the software layer the ai companies to startups they want cheaper compute but they can't use the ones that are being provided by a lot of d-pin projects because there's not enough uptime there's not enough bandwidth there's not enough management of these these compute devices that are being plugged in we're probably the only d-pin project in the space that's actually able to guarantee these things whether it's for enterprises or medium-sized startups and that's why i talk about revenue right it shows in the revenue we have this revenue because we're actually able to service this demand earlier i think you touched on the software layer why you guys are the only one that can do achieve this right can you elaborate more and tell us more about this gap you were talking about aether actually has like over 100 engineers around the world working on this platform as a service layer the compute that's provided by the compute providers and the applications that are actually using the compute it is this way because each application has its own specific needs a gaming company can say hey i need compute what does it need to compute for right is it running a single instance in on the cloud for a game is it doing some ai generation within the game each of these instances require the compute to be utilized and used in a different way and that's what the software in between does it's telling the computer what it actually needs to do and for this to be able to service large companies fortune 500s enterprise great billion dollar revenue companies beyond bandwidth and uptime the feature set actually needs to be very very complete before they can use it and so that's something that we're consistently scaling the team to be able to do i'm growing the team to better service more and more companies we actually have hundreds of companies on our waitlist right now that say hey i want access to your compute but i needed to come with these this feature set and so we're building out those features more and more to onboard more revenue and more customers every day so you have better engineers and better software layer now we have a more experienced engineering team and the thing is we actually have this commitment to building it i think there's a lot of deep end projects that bootstrap the compute they issue the tokens to the compute providers and then they don't do the actual hard part right which is connecting the computer the demand the reason we want to have proof of revenue the reason that we're showcasing all of this publicly is because we want to make this public statement right make this public commitment to the fact that we're actually here to build this thing after the token is launched and actually make sure that the demand is actually serviced by our computer providers this is me asking you your personal opinion so i want to know what your due diligence process look like in case you want to invest in like a deep end project how do you spot a real winner i think it's pretty similar to due diligence for any crypto project right it's looking into the background of the team and it's looking at over time and i think especially for deep end this is true it's do they actually do what they say they do because again bootstrapping is the easy part right actually servicing the demand is the hard part for them to actually find customers and then build the software so that these customers can use your compute is you know the single defining factor of whether or not this project or this company can actually exist five years from now we talk on the channel that for this crypto bull run to happen a few conditions must align bitcoin having qe environment traditional finance funds getting into crypto and new narrative so speaking of new narrative do you believe that deep end is the new narrative we're waiting for the one weakness that deepen has from a narrative perspective is that it's hard for users to really interface with them it's different from t5 it's different from nfts that has fueled our last bull runs where users can come in and immediately do something where it gets really interesting or where the deep end narrative needs to really take off is there needs to be projects that actually come out and say like like an ai agent project that says hey we're built on top of these deep this deep end you're using you know you can interact with this ai agent or this ai assistant because of this deep end and it's much cheaper because of this deep end it's going to really fuel the narrative for deep end that's why i'm so excited about us announcing our eco grants program on our eco fund program and yeah working on it every day to make it go to market as soon as possible a lot of experts are saying that one reason we're not seeing a crazy bull run so far is because traditional finance markets attention is all on ai like ai related stocks you see nvidia going out tsmc has hit all-time high and it's just attracting a lot of investors from institutional wise and retail investors do you think this is true i don't think that there is a shortage of demand for larger funds and tratfi companies to want to partake in crypto but there is a compliance right or legislation barrier there if compliance can move for crypto i don't think there's any shortage of demand from tratfi companies to want exposure to our space it's really down to a compliance issue experts are saying there might be a stock market downturn right and on the other hand we are still waiting for this crypto bull market to really boom do you think deep end price will follow this ai related stock or crypto market because it's kind of in the middle not financial advice to anyone what i think is it follows both and we've seen it with render throughout this cycle renders one of the better performing tokens throughout this like semi bull market that we've had and a lot of it is driven by the speculation around nvidia i don't think that's going to change from a retail perspective a lot of these deep end projects are still more affected by general crypto sentiment than it is by the ai sentiment or well the non-hardware related tech stocks is they are still backed very very strongly by something that's more real which is revenue right which is demand as compared to what a lot of tech stocks are backed by which is user count it's purely speculation right there's very little real value that's driving a lot of this and so it's significantly less sustainable and that's why i will come back now and show either not financial advice but even in the deepest of bear markets if there's a real demand there's real revenue and especially for us because of the way the protocol is designed this real revenue is directly again converted into buy pressure because the users need the ath token to access the compute that changes how resistant you are or it changes the way that your token might play out in market conditions help me visualize how big this potential size of deep sector is going to be if we look at our total addressable marketing growth today ai training 7.1 billion cloud gaming 1.9 billion cloud phone 22 billion edge compute 2 billion based on growth projections in five years the lower bound of just the market that our business unit addresses and not all of deep in is 33 billion and the upper bound is 76 billion and that's in real actualized revenue right that's not taking into account the multiples that you see in the crypto market it could potentially be massive again not financial advice well that was insightful i love that anything else you want to add something i will end off with is a lot of projects see the token launch or tg is the beginning of the end uh sorry 12 june was when we uh tg we haven't even shown more than 10 percent of what we really have and what we've really been working on the last four to five years protocolization of the real business since 2021 but there's a lot that's ongoing and if you look at our tokenomics emissions are planned for four years five years ten years we want to be a project that's here to stay uh we believe we can do it because we have real revenue and it's not targeted at driving short-term speculation it's built towards incentivizing long-term value and long-term participation thank you jayden that was very insightful and i honestly learned so much from you yeah thank you so much for having me it was an absolute pleasure thank you for watching and we'll see you next time!
