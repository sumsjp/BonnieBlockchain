 I don't want to disappoint you, but you might blow up. It's too painful. I hope I can figure that out tonight. Why are we here? Force is better than our jobs. Sorry about that. I will tell you, flat out, it's not possible. Being CEO, it's a craft. It's no different than cooking. It's no different than gardening. Or do I think the next amazing revolution is going to come? And this is going to be flat out one of the biggest ones ever. And I'm going to tell you, great athletes and great achievers all have this one characteristic. They have the ability to. One of the things that most people don't do very well This is an NVIDIA CEO. It is the share of Bruce Joinidon at the fake NBA University in the United States the path of success for young people the difficulties they may encounter the twists and turns of their mind If you actually want to break out of a day but are afraid to give up a more stable life then you must watch this video If you have some family or students who are choosing the path of trouble for science then you must share this video with them If you encounter failure at work or someone you hate at work or your performance is not as expected and you feel like you are starting to get bored then you must watch this video because this video helps me solve many of my inner struggles You can help yourself after watching this video I am now, I think, the longest running tech CEO working today I've been working in tech for 30 years It's a privilege to do it You're surrounded by amazing people In our case, we're the largest tech company in the world We've had a lot of success We've had a lot of success We've had a lot of success We've had a lot of success We've had a lot of success We've had a lot of success We've had a lot of success We've had a lot of success We've had a lot of success We've had a lot of success We've had a lot of success We've had a lot of success We've had a lot of success We've had a lot of success We've had a lot of success We've had a lot of success We've had a lot of success We've had a lot of success We've had a lot of success We've had a lot of success We've had a lot of success We've had a lot of success But it's a good business that also makes a great impact on the world And the work that you do is really important to other people So the combination of running a good business and the skills of doing that I had to learn along the way The purpose of a company that can make such a great impact on the industry and markets around the world and society is a great privilege And then also to have done something that the world's never done before and do it for the first time Singularly the company that invented this field of computing It's just incredible, incredible fun So our first question is on starting NVIDIA So in the crowd we have many aspiring tech entrepreneurs that are close in age when you first founded NVIDIA Can you tell us a bit on how you came to start NVIDIA? What was the spark that led you to start this amazing journey? Do you have some advice for some of the entrepreneurs in the crowd who plan on starting their own journeys one day? Whatever you do, don't start a graphics company NVIDIA being the last I've always said that NVIDIA was the last computer graphics company founded And that says something about strategy We were one of a hundred computer graphics companies and also the last one founded How is it possible that we're the largest in the world today and the only one remaining? There's a strategy study in there somewhere And that suggests that being first is not necessarily the best You could argue that being the first 99 isn't the best And sometimes being last is not necessarily even the worst The battle between two computer architecture approaches over the course of time using processors on the one hand which is general purpose writing software that does anything that runs on a computer versus an acceleration method has gone on for a very long time About 30 years ago, Chris and Curtis, two other founders of NVIDIA wanted to do something different and they wanted me to join them I was really happy with my job and we had two great kids and a great dog and we had a great family and so I was perfectly happy doing what we're doing But they insisted I join them to do something And so the three of us met on regular basis at Denny's and then we conceived of what NVIDIA is today an accelerated computing company And that was really as simple as the beginning as anything I don't think that startups need to form out of extraordinary angst or incredible opportunity We were three good friends and we've made good friends today and there was an opportunity to work together and we had to go figure out what to do So I think that entrepreneurial approach to solving problems looking for opportunities persist to this day It could be a random Tuesday and we're trying to think of something new to go do or something we can do with something that we know or an opportunity to arise that we can go take advantage of and the company is reinventing itself all the time So this basic method of seeing problems or seeing opportunities or it just happens to be Tuesday creating something out of nothing is a skill that I think every company or every startup needs to have We apply that basic method all the time We don't have to reinvent ourselves during a tough day We don't have to reinvent ourselves because of an opportunity to arise We invent ourselves because we do And so the energy of looking for something new and a new way of doing something is always there I still remember it was about February or March, 1993 and it occurred to us we needed money and the place to go get it is Venture Capitalist and the way you do that apparently is to write a business plan And so I bought a book I mean the obvious thing to do is you buy a book And so I bought a book and it says, How to Write a Business Plan Now back then, how to write a business plan is not a TikTok video I wish it was And it wasn't even a YouTube video but it was like 490 pages written by Gordon Bell He wrote a book on how to start, how to build a company, how to start a company and it was like 490 pages or something like that And if I would have read the whole book there's no way a video would be in business today And so I glanced through it, kind of skimmed through it and tried to write my business plan The truth be told, NVIDIA never finished a business plan because I never could finish it And I'm not really even too sure how to finish one today And so I do remember this Our VC, Sequoia Capital & Sutter, incredible Venture Capitalist They asked for a business plan and so we put a business plan together And I could tell you that our forecast was off by so much There's no way to guess even worse than that And so we were off by so much Nobody would have expected the market to be this large Nobody would have expected our company to have taken so long to have gotten off the ground and for the CEO to take so long to figure it out And so all of that stuff was really, really hard to predict And so your question is probably, Why are we here? I hope I can figure that out tonight There is a belief that CEOs are extraordinary, amazing, really knowledgeable, really skilled people And that's just not true It is not true We're not incompetent, uninformed, really super lazy people either I don't want you to think that either However, I hope the one thing that I convey to you guys today is that in fact you probably have everything you need to be a great CEO already And if there's anything that I inspire you to do tonight it's just to go do it, but just don't start a graphics company But what was your question? How did I do it? It was more like how did you decide on such a model for Nvidia? That question is so loaded and it's hard to answer But let me tear it apart Okay, let me tear it apart There's a part about what does the company do What does the company do and for what reason it does it That's a really, really hard thing to figure out And you don't have to figure it out in one day Or you have the feelings for it but you don't know how to put it into words And the reason for that is because probably 30 years ago the concept of cloud computing didn't exist Maybe 30 years ago nobody would have believed artificial intelligence was possible or accelerated computing was a thing And so until these words come into existence it's okay that you don't have the words to describe it But you need to know what does the company do and for what reason it does it There's the second part Which is in what environment does this company exist? What kind of environment is it? Is it a nurturing stable environment? Is it a hostile volatile dynamic environment? And because by understanding what environment your company is going to be in i.e. the industry and the technology that governs it the fundamental dynamics of the industry By understanding some of these things And that's the reason why if you're in the technology industry having technical sensibility is really important You can't be ignorant of the fundamental dynamics of the vehicle you're trying to build The fleet you're trying to build, the ship you're trying to build And so understanding the fundamental dynamics of the industry is really important Now based on those dynamics it causes you to think about how to architect this machine, this machinery This machinery is essentially what Nvidia is Nvidia is a machine that builds a bunch of other machines that other people would call products But it's a machine and this machine has to be architected in a thoughtful way That is the fundamental job of the CEO And then the next part of it is how do you operate this machine? What are the rules that governs the operations of this machine? Because there will be many conflicting requirements of this machine And this machine will be dealing with all of those conflicts in a really distributed way because you can't possibly be governing everything overnight all by yourself And so you have to empower amazing people like Rene to be able to do some of these things And so what are the values that you encode in all of the people that you empowered? What are the principles by which they operate? What are the operating manuals, if you will, of this machine? And some people call that culture Some people say those are procedures and processes and best known methods There are a lot of ways to describe some of these things But basically it's what is this thing that we're doing? What does it do and for what reason? What is the architecture of the machine and why? And then how do you operate it? In a very large sense, all CEOs have to work those things out For the vast majority of my computer industry experience, it's been largely governed by Moore's law But we knew that Moore's law was going to run out of steam And at some point, the type of problems you want to solve In our case, the type of problems we want to solve are the ones that either Moore's law can't solve Or in the time of Moore's law, it's barely possible And so we came up with this way of doing something called accelerated computing Well, our world requires deep invention And a lot of discovery that hasn't been done before because we're the only company that's done it And so you don't know exactly what the recipe is You don't know exactly what the framework's going to be You don't know exactly how to go do that And so we architected a company that optimizes for a lot of innovation to happen Optimizes for a lot of agility to happen So for example, if we discovered, hey, this is a great new path This is going to work We could swarm the company towards it We could shift the company, pivot the company to it And to be able to do that, you need a company that allows you to do it And these are some of the things that you'll learn as you operate large companies Is that the CEO needs to create a system that allows the CEO your will Or the collective will of the organization to change the course of the company And talking about well-run business, one of your favorite books is The Innovator's Dilemma Hopefully many of you guys have read that book And the lesson learned that most people got from that book is that a well-run business can't afford to switch to a new approach That ultimately will replace the current business model until it's too late And you mentioned actually on one of the VC panel at GTC a couple years back That Nvidia almost went out of business seven times Many people probably don't know that they turned the company around over and over and over again Could you share with us that experience? And perhaps looking forward, what are some of the market indicators are you looking for to continue to time ahead of the market transitions? Well, in the beginning, in the beginning, we were just better at our jobs And I don't know how else to say it The first five years of our company, really talented people working super, super hard But building a company is a new skill There's nowhere in any books that would properly describe the circumstances that you're going to be in You're going to learn a lot about both just building with so few resources, number one Number two, the immense resources of the competition If your company is $100 million large and your competitors $10 billion large You know it's possible for them to give away the product to keep you at zero And so the question is how do you break into an industry that by the time that we showed up was relatively mature? And it's hard to tackle exactly one at the moment But I think a lot of it has to do with simultaneously learning how to be a company, learning how to build products A whole bunch of strangers coming together for the first time Dealing with competition that is really quite immense Trying to build a new product that the customer didn't even realize they wanted An ecosystem, an industry that doesn't know how to value the product that you built The list of issues for a startup is just immense And I don't know that there's any code to share with you aside from you've just got to get to it And I think that ignorance was not realizing it was impossible to do Looking back at Nvidia, I would say building Nvidia doesn't make sense The fact that we would build one of the world's most important computing models, approaches In the world that we're in and built up ecosystems all over the world from all of the industries that you've mentioned And being such a small company still, we're only 28,000 people large And you know how large the computer industry is and many of the companies Where one, a fraction of just about anybody's company, it's kind of hard to imagine It never occurred to me that it wasn't possible when I was at your age If you asked me to do it today, I would tell you flat out it's not possible Building the next Nvidia is just not possible And for a lot of reasons I'll tell you it's not possible But at the time I didn't know that it was impossible And that is your great gift In a lot of ways, I think you want to stay in that naïve state for quite a long time I don't mean naïve and uninformed, I was naïve and constantly learning So at a managerial level, your scope cuts across finance, marketing, technology, etc. etc. At your level, how do you manage to keep a high level view of where the company is going And also getting to the details of the technology, what innovations you guys need People strategy, thinking through layoffs or not laying people off, stuff like that How do you balance your time out so that you have a high level view But also get in the weeds of the work your teams are doing All of our best leaders are deep and wide You don't have to be the deepest and you don't have to be the widest, but you're deep and wide And so the only way to do so is one, to have deep interest in the work of others You really want to be able to make a difference You have to have the attitude, and I have the attitude That if I'm sitting with the finance team, I can make a contribution in finance If I'm sitting with the legal team, I can make a contribution in legal activities If I'm sitting with HR, I can make a contribution with HR And I'm sitting with the architects, I can make a contribution with the architects And I'm sitting with our research team, I can make a contribution to our research team You've got to believe that, you have to strive for that You can't always necessarily contribute as much as you like But you really have to strive for that As a CEO, you just have to strive for that Now the best leaders in our company all can do that They're all quite broad in their understanding of the issues at hand And that just takes experience After you work for a long time, if you stay with the company for a long time You're going to learn how things work I don't believe in the 10-year tenure I believe that you're just barely figuring it out after 10 years Hopefully they give you another 20, 30 years And so I think the dedication to the craft matters Being CEO, being a leader, being an entrepreneur, it's a craft It's no different than cooking, it's no different than gardening, it's a craft And you have to decide to dedicate yourself to the craft So I don't think there's any easy answer aside from that But you have to have curiosity, you have deep empathy for other people's work I genuinely care for the success of my engineering team, my business team, my marketing team, my HR team, my finance team I genuinely care for their success And I genuinely believe that I can bring some perspective to help them today And so that's the way to do it What are some of the opportunities that you experienced now That you wish you would have witnessed beforehand That helped shaped you become the person you are today? I can only tell you the great piece of advice I got when I was growing up Be a doctor Laughter Also, and he's absolutely right, my father was absolutely right Be a chemical engineer Because chemistry is always important That wasn't my path, it wasn't because they were wrong They're perfectly good careers, it just wasn't my path And you just got to figure out your path Where do I think the next amazing revolution is going to come? And this is going to be flat out one of the biggest ones ever, and I'm going to tell you And there's no question that digital biology is going to be it For the very first time in our history, in human history Biology has the opportunity to be engineering, not science When something becomes engineering, not science, it becomes less sporadic And exponentially improving It can compound on the benefits of the previous years And every company's contribution, every researcher's contributions Compound on each other For the very first time, we know how to represent biology Understand the language of biology We can represent the language of chemistry It's never happened before And I'm very proud to say that Nvidia is, you know, I think she's the best Nvidia is, you know, at the center of all of that And we've made it possible for some of this breakthrough to happen And now we're going to have incredible tools That brings the world of biology, which is very chaotic and random Or not random, but very chaotic And constantly changing and very diverse and complex, obviously And bring it into the world of computer science And that is going to be profound And so if you happen to love this intersection I think it's going to be rich with opportunities It's going to be a giant industry You mentioned that you have two great kids and a great dog and a great wife You're comfortable with where you work So I'm wondering, you know, what makes you make the final decision to switch? I feel it's very hard, especially when we are already feeling comfortable You know, make good money and you had to sacrifice give up everything else and make a switch And is it because you truly believe your friends, you know, envision a good team? Or you already envision a good technology or just because of random Tuesday? I believe in them and I believe in myself to be able to build something And now the question is, at the time, do we really have our vision about what we're going to build? Did it really manifest? The answer is not really But I believe in them and I believe in myself I also believe that even though we had a family and our kids were young, they were just one and two We had a lot of responsibility and we were young parents And I could say that that could cause us to be quite risk averse But I was never concerned about being able to do something else if it didn't work out And so I felt like I wasn't risking anything And maybe that's too careless by some other standards But I really believed in it I believe that we weren't putting our family in harm's way And if things don't work out, there'll be an even better job for me somewhere, someday We were young, Lori and I were young So it wasn't a decision that was so difficult per se It was probably even less than a dinner conversation Maybe even less than that And so I think all of you are young and bright And there's so much opportunity out there I genuinely don't believe that when you make a decision to start a company or join a startup Frankly, I don't think it's a horribly difficult life decision The only thing that really matters is, in my estimation, are you going to love the people that you work with? Are you going to love the work that you're going to do? Are you going to love it so much that all the pain and suffering that's going to come your way Which I promise you will be lots The pain and suffering and the setbacks and the disappointments The list of bad days If you were to pile them all together into one moment for me Like Renee was trying to do earlier The seven times you almost went out of business and piled it into one instance You might blow up But don't do that That's why I didn't answer it It's too painful And so as you know, great athletes and great achievers all have this one characteristic They have the ability to forget the last moment That was the last point That was the last down That was the last whatever That was the last game The ability to forget And boy, I've got to tell you, I've got an incredible ability to forget And so you've just got to let the past be the past And that helps you with your resilience And so long as you love the work that you do You'll be able to keep on carrying on And that's really it That's 100% of the wisdom Was, in your opinion, your biggest mistake and how did you overcome it in your business life? I don't want to disappoint you I'm not going to lie with you, but the number of mistakes that I've made is so many That it's hard for me to really say, wow, you're the champion And the reason for that is right now as you're asking the question If you don't make that many mistakes, then one kind of stands out Do you know what I'm saying? If you make mistakes all the time, you're going to have a hard time picking one out I'm kind of loving all of them I love all my children Because when it's a success, it's somebody else's success But it's a mistake, it's yours And so I've made strategy mistakes However, it led to something really great I've made execution mistakes However, I learned more deeply about the craft Which then led me to become better at managing that I've made, walked away from business I shouldn't have I've taken business I shouldn't have So I'm not exactly sure what I learned from either one of those Okay, and so I think the list, the only thing that I will tell you about that is You have to learn how to estimate opportunity cost One of the things that most people don't do very well is estimating opportunity cost, only cost Because when you look at your P&L, it doesn't ever describe opportunity cost Is that right? It only describes the things that you did do and the cost that incurred as a result of that It turns out most of life is about the things that you could have done but you didn't have time to do And when you're the CEO of the company, the company's resources, that's what you manage And it's really important not to squander that The fundamental job is to create the conditions by which the company succeeds and do their best work And selecting projects that are worthy of our company And that's really about what to choose and what not to choose And what not to choose is really, really important because we only have 28,000 people And if you kind of loaded your plate with nothing but salad and fruit at the buffet line When you walk up to that rib eye and that fried chicken is going to be tough And so, okay, that was a CEO joke, CEO joke Everybody's going, but everybody here is vegetarian
